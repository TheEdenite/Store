        <p>
            Our world-famous fries, the from the original fry we made way back in 0, all the way to the modern artificial curl that you know and love with all your heart.
            <br>
            Fried using a pan, oil, and fire, the way nature intended. One type of them is, at least. The others are cheaper, though.

                The fry from 0 that actually tastes good. We've been doing this since the beginning, so we're almost as good as McDonalds.

                Probably not a waffle. Probably.

                This one is pretty self-explanatory. Its... it's a potato. I mean, really, you should just get this and make your own fries, they'll be better than anything but our OG fry.

            <dd>
                After enough time, we actually radiocativally simulated sentiant live potatoes, then genetically modified, killed, fried, and dipped them in butter to get this.
