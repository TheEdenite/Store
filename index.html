            The mission of Fries n' Stuf (a worldwide company est. 0,) is to establish domestic tranquility, ensure domestic welfare, and make fries. And stuff.
            The idea first began in the year 0 when we saw the fuss made over a little baby being born in a barn; and so we went out to work in barns and 
            their counterparts (farms). During that year, we got rather tired fo the whole walking thing and instead just started teleporting. Thus, we discovered Idaho. There was 
            really nothing to do there except farm potatoes, so we took potatoes and tried to burn them all. Unfortunately, we were only able to fry them, but 
            it tasted pretty good. Hence, our company was born.
